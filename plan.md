### Planning Notes

To create a chess game, we'll need to:
1. Set up a project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. Create the chessboard representation and visual layout
3. Implement the chess game logic (piece movement, validation, checks, etc.)
4. Build a user interface for player interaction
5. Implement gameplay features like move history, captures, checkmate detection

We'll use a web-based approach with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive chess game that runs in a browser.
